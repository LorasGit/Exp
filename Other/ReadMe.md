Location for graphics needed for other Ellucian sites: Self-Service and Colleague UI. Theoritially they should be at the same level as the EXP (Experience) site but they only have one file each at the time I'm making this. 


SelfService.png is the logo for Self-Service. It is currenlty being used in On Prem Self-Servace.  https://lorasgit.github.io/Exp/Other/SelfService.png 
UILogo.png is the logo for Colleague UI. The version on www2 is currently being used, this one should be used https://lorasgit.github.io/Exp/Other/UILogo.png



Other files shared between Experience and SS/UI not in this folder (because they're also potentionally used in Experience):
The ACC Flag background used on the Colleague UI login should be https://lorasgit.github.io/Exp/Banner/AtriumFlags.jpg
favicon.ico which is the gold seal and an actual ico file. https://lorasgit.github.io/Exp/favicon.ico
favicon.png which is the putple seal as a png that Experience uses and I assume could be used is https://lorasgit.github.io/Exp/favicon.png
